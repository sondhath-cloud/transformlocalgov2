## Important Notes

1. **config.php File**
   - This file does NOT exist in the ZIP
   - You must create it from config.sample.php
   - Add YOUR database credentials
   - This prevents accidental credential exposure

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - SiteWorks provides free SSL with AutoSSL
   - Takes a few minutes to activate
   - Always use HTTPS for security

3. **Domain Resolution**
   - Test both www and non-www versions
   - Some hosting setups prefer one over the other
   - Both should work after DNS is configured

4. **Form Testing**
   - Always test forms after deployment
   - Check phpMyAdmin to verify data is saving
   - Test with real data, not just clicking submit

5. **Image Loading**
   - All images are optimized for web
   - Should load in under 1-2 seconds
   - Use browser Network tab to verify
